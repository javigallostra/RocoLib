# RocoLib entities

Below is the list of entities and relations between them (as stored in [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)). 

Actual wall images are currently stored with the source code, inside the `static/images/walls` path. For each gym there is a `static/images/walls/{gym_id}` folder used to store the gym images.


## Gyms

**Collection**: `walls` 

**Gym fields**:

* **id** (`str`): Gym identifier for internal use. 
* **name** (`str`): Display name for the gym. This is the name that the user will see.
* **coordinates** (`double[]`): Array containing the coordinates of the gym location in the form: `[Longitude, Latitude]`.

## Walls

A gym entity has an associated collection of walls. 

For each gym there is a collection `{gym_id}_walls` -where `{gym_id}` is the value of the `id` field of the gym- that contains the list of walls related to that gym. 

**Collection**: `{gym_id}_walls` 

**Wall fields**:

* **image** (`str`): the name of the image that should be shown when creating/showing a problem on that wall. 
* **name** (`str`): Display name of the gym section/wall. This is the name that the user will see when referring to this section/wall. 
* **radius** (`double`): the radius of the circle to be used when drawing problems in that wall.

**Problem fields**:
* **rating** (`double`): Problem rating computed as the mean rating.
* **raters** (`int`): Number of raters.

* **creator** (`str`): Username of problem creator.
* **difficulty** (`str`): Suggested problem difficulty.
* **feet** (`str`): Feet restrictions for the problem.
* **holds** (`holds[]`): Array of holds making the problem.
* **section** (`str`): Image name of the section where the climb is located.
